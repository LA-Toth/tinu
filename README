What is TINU?
-------------

  TINU is a unit testing framework for C and C++ (through a wrapper) languages.
  It was designed to give the programmer as much helpful information as neccessary,
  so that errors found can be traced down and fixed as fast as possible. Unfortunately
  this makes tinu a bit bigger than other unit test frameworks.

How to compile?
---------------

  TINU uses autoconf and automake for building. However you don't need to have them
  installed (only if you intend to modify the Makefiles and the configure files).

  Compiling can be done the following way:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr

  After configure returns without errors, you can build and install the package the
  following way:

    $ make
    $ make install

How to use?
-----------

  Using Tinu is easy. If you compile your unit tests by hand, use the following:

    $ $CC -o unittest unittest.c $(pkg-config tinu --libs --cflags)

  If you use Tinu from autoconf/automake project, just add

    PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LIBTINU, tinu >= 0.1a)

  to your configure.ac file and

    yourunittest_CFLAGS = @CFLAGS@
    yourunittest_LDFLAGS = @LDFLAGS@

The CPP wrapper
---------------

  Tinu has a CPP wrapper (called cxxwrap) for making Tinus integration into C++
  projects easier. At the time of writing the following C/C++ mappings have been
  implemented:

    * CxxTinu: wrapper for the tinu_main, tinu_test_add and related functions. Should
               be instantiated at the beginning of the main function. No further
               actions are neccessary as the destructor takes care of running the
               main function and returning the appropriate response.

    * CxxTest: test cases can be implemented with these. CxxTest descended classes
               are registered using CxxTinu::add_test.

    * CxxMessageHandler: used for implementing custom message handlers.

    * CxxLeakwatch: used for implementing custom leak-detectors.

    * There are also other classes but they are used with the ones mentioned above.
